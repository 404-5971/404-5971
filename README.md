### ⚖️ Engineering Philosophy

I believe that **reliability is not an accident**. In a landscape often filled with fragile scripts, I prioritize rigor, type safety, and reproducibility across every ecosystem I touch.

* **Strict Typing:** I enforce safety at compile-time, not runtime. Whether it is **TypeScript** for the web or **Mypy/Pyright** for Python, I refuse to write "guesswork" code.
* **Next-Gen Tooling:** I value speed and determinism. I utilize **uv** and **Bun** to manage dependencies instantly, ensuring my environments are as fast as they are stable.
* **Standardization:** Code should look uniform regardless of who wrote it. I rely on opinionated formatters like **Black** and **Prettier** to eliminate bike-shedding and maintain production standards.
* **The Workflow:** My environment is a custom-tooled **Neovim** setup on **Arch Linux** (Hyprland), designed to minimize the friction between thought and implementation.
